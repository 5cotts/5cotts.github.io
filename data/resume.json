Especially adept at facilitating conversation between engineering and product teams to help engineers understand business requirements and help product managers understand the work that goes into building and maintaining software.<br><br>Most of my experience lies in back-end programming, where I have developed algorithms which support mission critical processes such as ETL pipelines, data merging, and data analysis. I have also worked on building front-ends, APIs, and microservices and have experience in cloud administration, database administration, Linux systems administration, and DevOps pipeline administration."

The current compute infrastructure I oversee includes five ECS clusters, with each cluster executing a multitude of different tasks and services on over 60 EC2 instances. Code deploys are applied to each ECS cluster via Docker images stored in ECR. Code deploys are executed in GitHub Actions using workflow templates I wrote. Each build not only creates a new Docker image, but runs unit tests with the new code before the deploy is allowed to pass. The data infrastructure I manage includes 8 RDS instances, 2 ElasticSearch clusters, 2 Redis caches, and over 3TB of files stored on S3. One task I was proud of in this area was using DMS to create live serving mirrors of our product databases which our products are pointed to. This ensures that our resource intensive ETL processing jobs do not cause our main product to slowdown.",

Also. maintain a look up table in Postgres which contains metadata about each scrape and it's location in S3 so that scrapes are queryable by other steps in our ETL pipelines.",
                                "Built and manage multiple internal web apps that allow non-technical users to complete various tasks pertinent to the company. Examples of such tasks include submitting and editing data that is viewable on the product and orchestrating what the suite of web scrapers (mentioned above) should scrape and when. These apps were built with Python using a combination Flask, uWSGI, and Jinja.",
                                "Also built and manage micro-services for internal use by engineers. One such service is one that can translate Chinese strings into English using an in-house data store which was built upon Google Translate API data and internal-user submitted translations. These services were also created using Flask, uWSGI, and Jinja, but with the addition of Flask JSON-RPC to expose an API layer.",
                                "Wrote multiple scripts in Python to support the ETL pipeline that takes our raw scraped data and turns it into something our product uses. Over time, have consistently iterated on these scripts to decrease run time. Most recently, I have been converting these tasks to be parallel processes using Python's Multiprocessing library.",
                                "A lot of data we store contains relationships between entities. I wrote code that traverses this data to find nodes for which we are lacking sufficient information (e.g, we may know the name of a node, but don't have all it's metadata). Wrote a separate process that then takes these incomplete nodes and queues them for scraping by our web scrapers using another micro-service I wrote.",
