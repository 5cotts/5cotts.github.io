    <center><h3>about</h3></center>
    Software engineer with over two years experience building products from the ground up. A team player,
    who is comfortable working independently and with others. Especially adept at facilitating conversation between
    engineering and product teams to help engineers understand business requirements and help product
    managers understand the work that goes into building and maintaining software.
    <br>
    <br>
    Most of my experience lies in back-end programming, where I have developed algorithms which support mission
    critical processes such as ETL pipelines, data merging, and data analysis.
    I have also worked on building front-ends, APIs, and microservices and have experience in cloud administration,
    database administration, Linux systems administration, and DevOps pipeline administration.

        <h4>Engineering Team Lead | 01/2020-12/2021</h4>
            Working directly under the CTO, I help lead a small group of engineers. We are currently iterating on the
            beta prototype of the product. In addition to writing code, I also conduct code reviews,
            architect new services/features, and act as liaison between engineering and product teams
            to help translate business needs into engineering outcomes.
            <br>
            <br>
            More detailed examples of what I have done include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                With input from the CTO, architected all infrastructure on AWS for the company. The current compute
                infrastructure I oversee includes five ECS clusters, with each cluster executing a multitude of
                different tasks and services on over 60 EC2 instances. Code deploys are applied to each ECS
                cluster via Docker images stored in ECR. Code deploys are executed in GitHub Actions
                using workflow templates I wrote. Each build not only creates a new Docker image, but runs unit
                tests with the new code before the deploy is allowed to pass. The data infrastructure I manage
                includes 8 RDS instances, 2 ElasticSearch clusters, 2
                Redis caches, and over 3TB of files stored on S3. One task I was proud of in this area was
                using DMS to create live serving mirrors
                of our product databases which our products are pointed to. This ensures that our resource intensive ETL
                processing jobs do not cause our main product to slowdown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrote web scrapers in Python using various tools such as Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Requests in
                order to download and store data in S3 coming from different kinds of data stores
                (e.g., embedded in HTML, stored in API responses, stored in CSVs, etc.). Also. maintain a look up
                table in Postgres which contains metadata about each scrape and it's location in S3 so that scrapes
                are queryable by other steps in our ETL pipelines.
            </li>
            <li>
                Built and manage multiple internal web apps that allow non-technical users to complete various tasks
                pertinent to the company. Examples of such tasks include submitting and editing data that is
                viewable on the product and orchestrating what the suite of web scrapers (mentioned above) should
                scrape and when. These apps were built with Python using a combination Flask, uWSGI, and Jinja.
            </li>
            <li>
                Also built and manage micro-services for internal use by engineers. One such service is one that can
                translate Chinese strings into English using an in-house data store which was built upon
                Google Translate API data and internal-user submitted translations. These services were also
                created using Flask, uWSGI, and Jinja, but with the addition of Flask JSON-RPC to expose an API
                layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrote multiple scripts in Python to support the ETL pipeline that takes our raw scraped data and turns
                it into something our product uses. Over time, have consistently iterated on these scripts to decrease
                run time. Most recently, I have been converting these tasks to be parallel processes using Python's
                Multiprocessing library.
            </li>
            <li>
                A lot of data we store contains relationships between entities. I wrote code that traverses this data
                to find nodes for which we are lacking sufficient information (e.g, we may know the name of a node,
                but don't have all it's metadata). Wrote a separate process that then takes these incomplete nodes and
                queues them for scraping by our web scrapers using another micro-service I wrote.
            </li>
            <li>
                Will occasionally add new front-end features to our main product using JavaScript. The main product is
                a Django web app with a Python back-end and JavaScript front-end.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Software Engineer | 05/2019-01/2020</h4>
            This was a multi-faceted full stack position where I worked across both research and engineering functions
            to help build the product using an Agile method of development. With a small team, we built the alpha
            prototype which led to a seed investment by a venture capital firm.
        <h4>Research Assistant | 02/2019-05/2019</h4>
            Worked part-time while continuing to take college classes. Responsibilities included strategic planning and
            development of business/product processes using a combination of qualitative research and data analysis.

        Using the open source <a href="https://rocket.chat/">Rocket.Chat</a> platform, I manage my own private chat
        server on AWS to keep in touch with my friends. I was inspired to do this in order to keep my digital footprint
        more secure and in my control.
