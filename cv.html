    <center><h3>about</h3></center>
    Software engineer with over two years experience building products from the ground up. A team player,
    who is comfortable working independently and with others. Especially adept at facilitating conversation between
    engineering and product teams to help engineers understand business requirements and help product
    managers understand the work that goes into building and maintaining software.
    <br>
    <br>
    Most of my experience lies in back-end programming, where I have developed algorithms which support mission
    critical processes such as ETL pipelines, data merging, and data analysis.
    I have also worked on building front-ends, APIs, and microservices and have experience in cloud administration,
    database administration, Linux systems administration, and DevOps pipeline administration.

    <h4>WireScreen | Engineering Team Lead | 2019-present | <a href="https://wirescreen.ai">wirescreen.ai</a></h4>
    Working directly under the CTO, I help lead a small group of engineers who solve networking puzzles and derive
    intelligence through data analysis. I have been with the company as it has
    grown from an idea, to a venture-backed start-up looking to compete with some of the world's best
    data intelligence providers. I have personally worked on each iteration of the product that
    has helped the company acquire additional funding and gain customers. In addition to writing code,
    I review code, architect new services/features, and act as liaison between engineering and product
    teams to help translate business needs into engineering outcomes. Prior to becoming the engineering team lead,
    I started as an intern and was offered a full-time position as a software engineer.

    <h4>Private Chat Server | <a href="https://friends.scottschmidt.io">friends.scottschmidt.io</a></h4>
    Using the open source <a href="https://rocket.chat/">Rocket.Chat</a> platform, I manage my own private chat server
    on AWS to keep in touch with my friends. I was inspired to do this in order to keep my digital footprint
    more secure and in my control.
