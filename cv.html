    <center><h3>about</h3></center>
    I started coding when I was young by reverse engineering websites and creating my own static HTML webpages
    (much like this one). Despite this, I found myself studying economics and business in college.
    After convincing myself I wanted to become a CPA, and then convincing myself I wanted to become a PhD economist,
    I found myself coding again and haven't stopped since. Unlike when I was younger, I now see the power
    technology has and how it can impact the world, for better or worse. My goal is to develop technologies
    that benefit society.
    <center><h3>technical competencies</h3></center>
    Most of my engineering work and interest lies in back-end programming; specifically involving problems of
    optimization and resource constraints. Although I would call myself a software engineer, some may say that a
    lot of what I worked on falls in the realm of data engineering. I have a good bit of experience improving
    the algorithms which support ETL pipelines. I have also worked on building front-ends, APIs, and microservices.
    I also have experience in cloud administration, database administration, Linux systems administration,
    and DevOps. I have completed coursework in statistics & mathematics which allows me to have a basic level
    of competence in some data science concepts (I can explain how linear regression works and what neural networks
    are) but am always eager to learn more about this topic and find ways to apply it in my work.

    <h4>WireScreen | engineering team lead | 2019-present | <a href="https://wirescreen.ai">wirescreen.ai</a></h4>
        At WireScreen, I work with an amazing group of engineers, journalists, and other professionals who strive to
        make the world a better place by increasing corporate transparency. I have been with the company as it has
        grown from an idea with some data in a Google Drive to a venture-backed seed stage start-up looking to take on
        some of the world's best intelligence providers. I have personally worked on each iteration of the product that
        has helped the company gain more funding and exposure to clients. In addition to writing code,
        I also review code, architect new services/features, and help translate business needs from product
        users into engineering outcomes.

    <h4>EY | Consultant Intern | 2017 | <a href="https://www.ey.com/">ey.com</a></h4>
        Worked out of EY's Munich, Germany office advising clients on U.S. bound real-estate investments.
        Aber jetzt, ich kann ein bisschen deutsche sprechen.
    <h4>Wellington Management | Analyst Intern | 2016 | <a href="https://www.wellington.com/">wellington.com</a></h4>
        Worked on the team that dealt with the tax related consequences of structuring and running cross-border
        investment funds. Performed lots of legal research and vlookups in massive Excel spreadsheets.
        Also wrote a shell script that partially automated the generation of yearly reports which were mailed to clients
        (this is probably when I should have realized I had a knack for computers).
    <h4>KLR | Accountant Intern | 2015 | <a href="https://kahnlitwin.com/">kahnlitwin.com</a></h4>
        My first office job. I worked during busy season and prepared tax returns for both individuals and
        organizations. Every year, I still receive phone calls from friends asking for help with their taxes.
