    <center><h3>about</h3></center>
    Software engineer with over two years experience building products from the ground up. A team player,
    who is comfortable working independently and with others. Especially adept at facilitating conversation between
    engineering and product teams to help engineers understand business requirements and help product
    managers understand the work that goes into building and maintaining software.
    <br>
    <br>
    Most of my experience lies in back-end programming, where I have developed algorithms which support mission
    critical processes such as ETL pipelines, data merging, and data analysis.
    I have also worked on building front-ends, APIs, and microservices and have experience in cloud administration,
    database administration, Linux systems administration, and DevOps pipeline administration.

        <h4>Engineering Team Lead | 01/2020-present</h4>
            Working directly under the CTO, I help lead a small group of engineers. We are currently iterating on the
            beta prototype of the product. In addition to writing code, I also conduct code reviews,
            architect new services/features, and act as liaison between engineering and product teams
            to help translate business needs into engineering outcomes.
        <h4>Software Engineer | 05/2019-12/2019</h4>
            This was a multi-faceted full stack position where I worked across both research and engineering functions
            to help build the product using an Agile method of development. With a small team, we built the alpha
            prototype which led to a seed investment by a venture capital firm.
        <h4>Research Assistant | 02/2019-05/2019</h4>
            Worked part-time while continuing to take college classes. Responsibilities included strategic planning and
            development of business/product processes using a combination of qualitative research and data analysis.

    <h3>Private Chat Server | <a href="https://friends.scottschmidt.io">friends.scottschmidt.io</a></h3>
    Using the open source <a href="https://rocket.chat/">Rocket.Chat</a> platform, I manage my own private chat
    server on AWS to keep in touch with my friends. I was inspired to do this in order to keep my digital footprint
    more secure and in my control.
